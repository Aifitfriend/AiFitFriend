# Mobile Development 
Using the Kotlin programming language to create applications. Using the X camera to detect movement and machine learning will be integrated through the TensorFlow implementation. Data generated from training results will be stored using DataStore.

# Implementation Design
Create and design user interface designs using Figma. And to implement the design we use Android Studio using XML layout.

# Implementation to Apps
After we designed the user interface mock up, the next step was for us to create the application using Android Studio using the Kotlink programming language. We implement the design or mock up of the user interface that we create and then we realize it into a real application. We use several libraries, namely Retrofit to handle internet connections, Lotie library to add animated images, Data Store library to store databases, and finally the Camera X library to record video and detect movement.

## Application Development roadmap
During application creation we implement it into two main processes, namely Design Implementation and Application Implementation.
- For design implementation, it starts with analyzing and understanding the application design thoroughly, including layout, colors, and UI/UX elements. And ensure that the design can meet the desired goals and user needs.
- For Application implementation begins with determining the technology that will be used for the backend and frontend based on needs. Continue with building the backend infrastructure, including servers and databases, after that implement the UI/UX design into the user interface.
