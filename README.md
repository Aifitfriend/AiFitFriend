Personal Fitness Tracker with Movement Recognition Model 

# Project Description
Maintaining a state of physical and health well-being is a challenging task, especially when exercises are performed at home without proper guidance. The absence of instructors and the lack of proper equipment can lead to incorrect execution of postures and exercises. As a way to resolve this problem, our team has come up with a solution to address improper posture during workouts. Users can select their preferred fitness program and engage in it as daily exercises. In the event that our model detects any incorrect posture, it will automatically pause the exercise and display a video demonstrating the correct form. Through consistent use of this application, users can efficiently achieve and maintain their personal fitness goals, even in the comfort of their homes!
